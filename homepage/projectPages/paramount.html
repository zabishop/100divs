        <p>
            This was my first HTML/CSS project and first client project ever.
        </p>

        <p>
            Previous to working on this project and negating my work with .erb templates, I had zero HTML/CSS
            experience. I was given this project as a test of sorts. Prior I had been working I was given a .psd file,
            shown how to cut the design up via Skype, and told "have fun."
        <p>
            I watched a couple videos on Lynda.com and got to it.
        </p>
        <p>It was a test of sorts. I had been struggling
            with Ruby on Rails and my manager thought that this kind of work might be a better fit.
        </p>

        <p>
            He was right.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a few days, I had finished the home page.  And it was pixel perfect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within a week, I had pounded out three more pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Withing a month I had finished the entire site.
