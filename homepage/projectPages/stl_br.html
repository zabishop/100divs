    <h2>STL Brew Review</h2>

    <div class="projectDescription">
        <p>This is project is my first venture into mobile development utilizing the PhoneGap/Cordova framework.
            Currently, it is still in development.</p>

        <p>The inner workings of this app are pretty straight forward. When first loaded, the app makes an
            XMLHttpRequest to stlbrewreview.com/breweries.json. The app then parses the JSON string for the details of
            each brewery, assigning each as an object in an array. This array is then passed them to a mustache template
            which is rendered for each entity in the array. </p>
           <img src="../assets/images/screen1.jpg">
        <p>When a user selects a brewery, the app retrieves the brewery's id from the item's data attribute, queries the
            array for the associated object, and passes the retrieved data to another mustache template. </p>
        <img src="../assets/images/screen2.jpg">
        <p>
            The details screen for each brewery is pretty straight forward; mostly a number of links that the user can
            use to find more information about the brewery. However, an important feature to note is the "Beer" link.
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/images/screen3.jpg">
        <p>
            When the beer link is clicked, the "short_name" attribute of the brewery's object is passed to function that
            generates a URL. This URL is then utilized to make a second XMLHttpRequest that retrieves and parses a JSON
            file that contains all the details of each beer. If it exists, this data is then sent to yet another
            mustache template that generates a list of beers for that brewery.
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/images/screen4.jpg">
        <p>
            If this data <i>does not</i> exist --
            which is possible since the site that this app pulls from has not been fully populated -- another (very
            basic) mustache template is render; one that merely alerts the user that this brewery does not have any
            beers listed.
